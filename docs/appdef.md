# Introducing the AppDef

The JARVICE Application Definition (AppDef) Reference describes the application interface for applications that are deployed on JARVICE with PushToCompute&trade;.

The JARVICE Application Definition (AppDef) is a simple JSON object which is used to define:

* The work flow (commands, data and parameters)
* The user interface (the Task Builder web form, and an API schema)
* Validation rules for the automatically generated API to run this application
* The command line entry point into the [Nimbix Application Environment (NAE)](nae.md).

By using a simple, declarative JSON object, the AppDef makes designing work flows and user experiences easy on JARVICE. No prior experience designing web interfaces or APIs is required to deploy a multi-node high performance computing application which leverages the built-in capabilities of JARVICE on the Nimbix Cloud.

# Examples

Nimbix provides various examples in the form of real-world applications - open source deployed on the Nimbix Cloud using JARVICE mechanisms.  By convention, the `AppDef.json` file typically lives in the `NAE` directory at the top of the source tree.  Most repositories in the [Nimbix GitHub account](https://github.com/nimbix) Include both an AppDef as well as directives in their respective `Dockerfile` to deploy it.  You can even start with the default AppDef generated when creating a new application and modify it for your specific workflow - see *Building and Deploying* in the [CI/CD Pipeline](cicd.md) section for more information on this.  The *Container metadata* section of the [Nimbix Application Environment](nae.md) section also describes how to store and validate `AppDef.json` files in your Docker image.  Please note that JARVICE ignores invalid AppDefs when deploying, and will also fail to build an application with an invalid AppDef.

# Reference

**Environment and Configuration**

Key|Type|Required/Optional|Description
---|---|---|---
`commands`|command (object)|required|Defines an application command in the application drop-down
`variables`|variable (object)|optional|Defines user and application-defined environment variables which will be available in `/etc/JARVICE/jobenv.sh`. This can be overridden in a command that is defined in the `commands` section.  These variables are set at the account level by Support and not user managed.
`identity`|identity (object)|optional|Defines user identity to use within the JARVICE environment.

**Storage and Machine Options**

Key|Type|Required/Optional|Description
---|---|---|---
`machines`|list of strings or shell-style wildcards|required|Machines can be any machine type available on Nimbix, or accepted lazy expansions. For example, `ng*` would make all x86 GPU machine types available for this application. This can be overridden in a command that is defined in the `commands` section.  See [Resource Selection](machines.md) for more information.
`scale_max`|integer|optional|Defines the maximum number of machines allowed for this application. This can be overridden in a command that is defined in the `commands` section.  Typical use is to limit applications to run on a single machine rather than allow the user to launch jobs with multiple nodes for applications that may not support it.
`vault-types`|list of strings|required|(If the application workflow does not support persistent storage, this should be `"vault-types”: [ “NONE” ]`); Defines what storage vaults are supported by the application. Must be one or more of of: `BLOCK`, `BLOCK_ARRAY`, `FILE`, or `NONE`.

**Service Catalog Information**

Key|Type|Required/Optional|Description
---|---|---|---
`name`|string|required|Defines the human-readable name of the application.
`description`|string|required|Description of the application used in the application market place icon.
`author`|string|required|Name of the individual or company who authored the application.
`licensed`|boolean|required|Defines whether the application requires an additional license. false = Application needs a third party license in order to run. true = Application pricing includes on-demand license costs or has no additional license fees.
`classifications`|string|required|Defines the categories used for sorting and searching applications.
`image`|image (object)|required|Defines the application icon.

**`image` Object Reference**

Key|Type|Required/Optional|Description
---|---|---|---
`data`|string|required|Base64 image data. This can easily be generated with: `cat image.png | base64 -w0`; Alternatively, the image can be uploaded directly in the PushToCompute&trade; section of the portal.
`type`|string|required|This identifies the media type, e.g., `image/png`

**`commands` Object Reference**

NOTE: Commands are named by the key of the JSON object defining the command.

Key|Type|Required/Optional|Description
---|---|---|---
`path`|string|required|Command entry point which is run in the Nimbix Application Environment when the application starts. For a graphical application, this could be `/usr/local/bin/nimbix_desktop` followed by a positional constant parameter with value `/usr/bin/xterm`; For a batch application, this could be the path to a batch script.  Be sure to use a full path here, not just an executable name that you assume to be in `${PATH}`.
`name`|string|required|Command’s name, which is used as the title of the command in the application’s catalog entry.
`description`|string|required|Description of the command’s functionality that is used in the application’s catalog entry.
`interactive`|boolean|optional|If true, a public IP address and host name is assigned to the NAE when it is launched. This should be true for any application using the Nimbix Desktop, as well as any application which provides SSH or HTTP access.
`noconnect`|boolean|optional|If true, does not return a web service connect URL even if the application image advertises one in `/etc/NAE/url.txt`; this can be used to hint to the web portal that the specific command should tail the output of stdout in the portal rather than provide a connection link, while still allowing remote access via public IP address as hinted by the `interactive` setting.
`parameters`|parameter (object)|required|Parameters are used to construct the arguments passed to the command identified by the `path` key of the command argument.  If the command takes no parameters, this key should still be included and set to `{}`
`machines`|list of strings|optional|Machines can be any machine type available on Nimbix, or accepted lazy expansions. For example, `ng*` would make all x86 GPU machine types available for this application. Including machines in this section overrides the machines defined in global scope and apply specifically to a given command, allowing differnet commands to offer different machine types to run on
`variables`|variable (object)|optional|Defines user and application-defined environment variables which will be available in `etc/JARVICE/jobenv.sh`.  These variables are set at the account level by Support and not user managed.

**`parameters` Object Reference**

Parameters are used to construct the arguments passed to the command identified by the `path` key of the `command` object.

Key|Type|Required/Optional|Description
---|---|---|---
`name`|string|required|Name of the parameter (used in the Task Builder).
`description`|string|required|Description of the parameter (used in the Task Builder).
`type`|string|required|Identifies the type of the parameter. One of: `CONST`, `STR`, `INT`, `FLOAT`, `RANGE`, `BOOL`, `selection`, `FILE`
`required`|boolean|required|true if parameter setting is required, false if optional
`variable`|boolean|optional|true if this parameter should be expressed as a variable in `/etc/JARVICE/jobenv.sh` rather than on the command line for the command referred to in the `path` key.  Default is false.
`positional`|boolean|optional|True indicates the value of the parameter should be passed as a positional argument, ordered by the order of JSON objects in the parameters section.
(parameter dependent fields)|–|varies by parameter type|See the parameter definition table below for keys and values required by parameter type.

**`variables` Object Reference**

Variables are designed to be used as environment variables and are written to `/etc/JARVICE/jobenv.sh`; these are set in the account itself and managed by Support.  The key of the variable becomes the name of the variable when the job is launched.

Key|Type|Required/Optional|Description
---|---|---|---
`name`|string|required|Defines a human-readable name of the variable.
`description`|string|required|Description of the variable.
`userowned`|boolean|required|If true, then the user may override this value  . If false, it is an account variable which is currently managed and set by Nimbix Support.  Please note that this parameter is currently ignored and is treated as false.
`inherit`|boolean|required|If true, the value of an account variable can be inherited from a team’s payer account.
`required`|boolean|optional|If true, the application will not launch if the variable is not defined.

**`identity` Object Reference**

Identity is used to configure a username, group, UID, and/or GID for the Nimbix Application Environment (NAE). These setting will replace the `nimbix` user created by [image-common](https://github.com/nimbix/image-common).

Key|Type|Required/Optional|Description
---|---|---|---
`username`|string|required|Username for JARVICE NAE. Spaces are not supported.
`group`|string|optional|Group for JARVICE NAE. Defaults to `nimbix` if not set.
`uid`|integer|optional|UID for JARVICE NAE. Defaults to `505` if not set.
`gid`|integer|optional|GID for JARVICE NAE. Defaults to `505` if not set.

NOTE:

* Setting the `identity` object for an App will replace the NAE `nimbix` user. The JARVICE API cannot override an `identity` set by an AppDef file.
* Setting `uid/gid` as root (0:0) is NOT supported.
* Using `uid/gid` values less than `1000` may collide with system users/services and should be avoided.

**Parameter Type Reference**

**CONST**

`CONST` defines a constant value and supports substitutions as well - the user may not modify these paraemters.  When the type is `CONST`, the `value` key may be either an actual value or one of the following substitutions:

* `%APIURL%` – public API URL \*
* `%APIUSER%` – username of user who submitted the call \*
* `%APIKEY%` – API key for user who submitted the call \*
* `%CORES%` – number of CPU cores in machine
* `%GPUS%` – number of GPUs in master node
* `%SGPUS%` – number of GPUs in each slave node
* `%RAM%` – amount of RAM in master node, in GB
* `%SRAM%` – amount of RAM in each slave node, in GB
* `%NODES%` – number of nodes selected
* `%TCORES%` – total number of cores selected (`%CORES%` * `%NODES%`)
* `%TGPUS%` – total number of GPUs selected (`%GPUS%` + (`%SGPUS%` * (`%NODES%` – 1)))
* `%TRAM%` – total amount of RAM selected (`%RAM%` + (`%SRAM%` * (`%NODES%` – 1)))
* `%JOBLABEL%` – job label, if specified
* `%VTYPE%` – vault type (e.g. NONE, FILE, OBJECT, BLOCK, BLOCK_ARRAY)

\* these substitutions are only available if the application is certified by Nimbix or the user calling the API owns the application; they are intended to facilitate job submission from inside jobs and should be used with care since this action can incur additional usage charges.

**STR**

`STR` defines a string value and is the default `type` if not specified.  The `value` key is an arbitrary default value to populate, which the user can edit; this may also be blank.

**INT**

`INT` defines an integer value and supports the following keys:

* `value` is the default value (which can be left blank to require an explicit value set)
* `min` is the minimum number
* `max` is the maximum number

The portal will express this as a slider widget.

**FLOAT**

`FLOAT` defines a floating point value and supports the following keys:

* `value` is the default value (which can be left blank to require an explicit value set)
* `min` is the minimum number
* `max` is the maximum number
* `precision` is the maximum number of decimal digits allowed (values will be truncated to this)

**BOOL**

`BOOL` defines a boolean value which includes the parameter if true, or omits it if false; this is useful for optional command line parameters.  It supports the following keys:

* `value` is the default, which must be set to true or false; once submitted, if true, the parameter will be listed on the command line, or not listed if false

Boolean parameters are represented as checkbox widgets in the user portal.

**selection**

`selection` defines a single selection list and supports the following keys:

* `values` is a list of values; the default will be the first one listed; if empty string is submitted (and is a valid selection), the parameter will not be listed
* `mvalues` is a parallel list of values in machine format; if specified, the index of `values` will be used to fetch the actual value to pass into the application from the `values` list; it must have the same exact dimension as the `values` list; if not specified, only the `values` list will be used

Selection lists are represented as drop down widgets in the user portal.

**FILE**

`FILE` defines a file name, and supports the following keys:

* `filter` is a list of wildcards to filter by (standard shell wildcard syntax); if there is more than one wildcard specified, use the \| (vertical bar) to separate them - e.g. to support C and Python files, use `*.c|*.py`

If the selected storage vault is listable (e.g. a `FILE` vault), the user portal will provide a file picker widget.

# Using Xilinx FPGA binaries

Nimbix hosts a variety of Xilinx FPGA [Machine Types](machines.md) on JARVICE. Applications utilizing Xilinx FPGAs will need to include a `*.xclbin` FPGA binary file. The [Xilinx SDAccel Development](https://www.nimbix.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NEW-ug1240-sdaccel-nimbix-getting-started-1018-1.pdf) environment is used to design an accelerated kernel and generate the corresponding `xclbin` file. There are two options available to use a `xclbin` file inside a JARVICE application.

##Standard

Add the `xclbin` file to an Application's container at `/etc/NAE` or `/opt/<example-app>`. 

Example using Dockerfile syntax:

`ADD kernel.xclbin /opt/example/kernel.xclbin`

Any executable inside the container can run the accelerated kernel using the standard Xilinx FPGA runtime.

\*Note: The `xclbin` file contains an FPGA bitstream for the kernel and will be accessible inside the container

##Protect kernel bitstream

The standard option is extended to protect a kernel's FPGA bitstream by configuring the FPGA before starting a user's session and removing the kernel bitstream from the `xclbin` file. The remaining information is metadata used by the Xilinx FPGA runtime. Enable bitstream protection by adding the following `variables` to an [Appdef command](appdef.md#reference):

**XCLBIN_BITSTREAM_PROGRAM**

`XCLBIN_BITSTREAM_PROGRAM` is the full path to an `xclbin` used to configure the FPGA. The bitstream will be removed after programming is complete. The remaining information is metadata required by the Xilinx FPGA runtime.

**XCLBIN_BITSTREAM_PROTECT**

(Optional) `XCLBIN_BITSTREAM_PROTECT` is a `|` separated list of `xclbin` files to delete from a container before a user session is started. The FPGA is not configured by any of `xclbin` files before deletion. This is useful for JARVICE applications with multiple Appdef commands using different FPGA kernels.
